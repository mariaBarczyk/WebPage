                        New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
                        The country geographically comprises two main landmasses—the North
                        Island (Te Ika-a-Māui), and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and
                        around 600 smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1,500
                        kilometres (900 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and
                        roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island
                        areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness,
                        it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long
                        period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity 
                        of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography 
                        and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much 
                        to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's 
                        capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.
